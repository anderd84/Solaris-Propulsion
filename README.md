# Solaris Propulsion Code

# This repository will house all of the code/calculations that are needed for developing the Cerberus Aerospike Engine
Any questions should be directed to **anderdm11@hotmail.com**

For any future teams looking to use this repository, sorry its left in a bit of a messy state
Most work is done using files in ```scripts/``` as main scripts, which interface with the bulk of the code as an API
The scripts require a bit of finesse to understand so please send me any questions with the email above. I can also assist you in reaching out to the others for engineering/design questions.
